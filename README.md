Appalachian State University Master's Project

This project consists of webscraping the English Premier League's website to acquire a dataset to predict soccer match outcomes during the season using machine learning classification models. This project was a lot of fun during my second to last semester within the Graduate program at Appalachian State University and I will continue to work on it in the future! As of right now, I would like to integrate neural networks to predict the probability of one team beating another within the season.
